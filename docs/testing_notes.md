# Test Planning
One of the main uses of this library is to replace a series of complicated spreadsheet tasks to find the numbers I'm looking for. However, testing to make sure the code is performing as expected requires that spreadsheet work to be done in order to have something to check the data against. This document is for later reference about what data and parameters were selected for testing.
