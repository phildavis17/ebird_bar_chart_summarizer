## What Questions Are We Trying to Answer
The main one: Will I see this bird?

-odds of at least one.


## Independant Events
These tools assume that the observation of a given species at different hotspots are indepentant events. I think there is a strong argument to be made that this is inccorrect.

I think a more accurate model would be to say that every species has a general regional liklihood and a hotspot specific liklihood, and the odds of seeing that species depends on both of those values. For instance, the regional liklihood of a migratory warbler species might depend on the time of year and geographic location, since you'd need to be in its migration path and during its migration season to see it, and its hotspot specific liklihood might depend on whether or not the hotspot in question has the kind of terrain and vegitation it prefers. 

Ultimately, I don't think eBird captures enough information to perform this kind of analysis with a reliable level of accuracy. The math
