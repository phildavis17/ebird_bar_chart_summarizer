# eBird Bar Chart Tools
A suite of tools for working with eBird histogram data.

## What does this do?
 - Summarize eBird histogram data over a given period
 - Combine and compare histogram data from multiple hotspots
 - Explore possible combinations of different hotspots
 - Produce sorted lists of birds sorted by frequency of observation

## Why would I want to do any of that?
There are three main use cases, but this isn't a complete list of everything it could be used for.

### Preparing for Travel
Work trip to Seattle? Summarize a few hotspots in the city around the date of your trip to get a quick understanding of what birds people see there.

Week-long birding trip to Costa Rica? Look at all the hotspots you'll be visiting in a single glance, and find out which spicies you're likely to encounter over the course of the whole trip.

### Planning Big Days
If you wanted to see as many species as possible on a single day without leaving Brooklyn, which hotspots should you visit? Use these tools to figure out which hotspots hold the most value, and which species you need to pick up at which location.

### Studying for Migration
Learning warblers by ear? Use these tools to produce a sorted list of which warblers are seen most frequently in April and May at your favorite migration birding spot. Focus on the common ones first, and know the rarities when you hear them.
